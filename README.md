# Monte Carlo Simulation for Balls and Bins Analysis

Welcome to my Monte Carlo simulation repository, where I delve into the intriguing balls and bins problem. The goal here is to determine the number of non-empty bins when N balls are randomly thrown into N bins.

## Lab Description

In this lab, I'll be conducting a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the balls and bins problem. I've written code to run simulations for N ranging from 1 to 1000 and visualize the results using the `matplotlib` plot function. You'll notice a striking linear relationship in the output. Your task is to determine the slope of this linear relationship using linear regression.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Monte Carlo simulation code provided in the repository.
3. Utilize `matplotlib` to plot the results.
4. Implement linear regression to find the best fit line for the dataset.
5. Analyze the output, particularly focusing on the slope and the `rvalue`.

## Example Output

Upon running the linear regression, you should obtain results similar to the following:

SciPy Linear Regression Solution
Slope: 0.6325801874018306
Intercept: -0.02602000798390236
rvalue: 0.997749733854947



Note: The `rvalue` is very close to 1, and the slope is approximately equal to the value of 1 - 1/e = 0.6325801874018306. An optional exercise is provided to explore why this relationship holds true.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed. Happy simulating!
