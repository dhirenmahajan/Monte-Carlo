# Monte Carlo Simulation for Balls and Bins Analysis

This repository contains code for running a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze a balls and bins problem. The objective is to determine the number of non-empty bins when N balls are randomly thrown into N bins.

## Lab Description

In this lab, you will conduct a Monte Carlo simulation for analyzing the balls and bins problem. You will write code to run simulations for N ranging from 1 to 1000 and visualize the results using the `matplotlib` plot function. The output should reveal a noticeable linear relationship. Your task is to determine the slope of this linear relationship using linear regression.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Monte Carlo simulation code provided in the repository.
3. Use `matplotlib` to plot the results.
4. Implement linear regression to find the best fit line for the dataset.
5. Analyze the output, particularly focusing on the slope and the `rvalue`.

## Example Output

Upon running the linear regression, you should obtain results similar to the following:
